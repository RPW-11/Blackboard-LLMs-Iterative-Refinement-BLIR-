**Important**

Before running the code, you need to create a `.env` file containing your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

## How to run the code

First, you need to set up a Python virtual environment. The current project uses Python 3.11.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Second, activate your virtual environment (below is for Linux and macOS operating systems).
``` bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Third, install all of the libraries.
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Fourth, run the main code.
``` bash
python src/main.py
```
